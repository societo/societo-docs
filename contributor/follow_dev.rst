Following Development of Societo
================================

Mailing List
------------

Currently, Societo has the `societo-dev <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/societo-dev>`_ list for discussion about development.

This list and its archive are all publicized and you're welcome to subscribed and join to discussion.

What's happened in development of Societo will be shared to this list first. So subscribing this list is a good way to follow development of Societo.

Now we don't have any other list (e.g. societo-user). They will be created when someone needs it.

We hope to replace this list to our developed discussion system on Societo in the future. It is a good that discussion about development of Societo can do on Societo itself, isn't it?

Blogs
-----

You can get announcements new release, what's happened with the development, and hint about using Societo, from our blog: http://societo.org/blog

And some contributors have own blog. There may be entries about Societo development.
